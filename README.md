# NLP
Natural Language Processing using Machine Learning

We'll be using a dataset from the [UCI datasets](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection).
The dataset we are using contains a collection of more than 5 thousand SMS phone messages.
We'll train a machine learning model to learn to discriminate between ham/spam messages automatically.
Then, with a trained model, we'll be able to classify arbitrary unlabeled messages as ham or spam.
